## Multilevel Modeling Learning Plan

This plan is a focused and structured approach to learning multilevel models. These are also known as hierarchical linear models (HLMs), linear mixed effects models (LMEs), and linear mixed models (LMMs).

I use linear mixed models in my work at Facebook to quantify the effect of marketing inputs on brand sentiment.

Below, I lay out learning goals, exercises to complete, and curriculum. Core work components will be notes, blog posts, and projects.

## Learning Goals

After completing this learning plan, I will

- [ ] know the differences between mixed effects, multilevel, and hierarchical models
- [ ] understand use cases of multilevel models
- [ ] be comfortable with basic MLM math theory
- [ ] be able to describe error structure of MLMs
- [ ] understand MLM model assumptions and diagnostics
- [ ] have created a glossary of key MLM terminology
- [ ] be familiar with packages for implementating mixed/multilevel models in R 

As a result, I should be to apply MLMs rigorously in
marketing mix models, and be able to identify some new use cases for MLMs

I will also create a trail of materials to make it easier for other to learn about MLMs.

## Exercises

Write about 
- [ ] purpose of MLMs
- [ ] assumptions of MLMs
- [ ] difference between fixed and random effect
- [ ] difference between MLE and REML
- [ ] diagnostics of MLMs

Complete project
- [ ] 1 using MLM   
- [ ] 2 using MLM
