## Multilevel Modeling Learning Plan

Multilevel models, or linear mixed models, are a type of regression used to model grouped data. 

Here is a learning plan for better understanding the motivation, basic theory and assumptions, and applications for multilevel models. The end of this lesson plan should culminate in a couple blog posts, as well as a side project. 

## Learning Goals

After completing this learning plan, I will

- [ ] Know the differences between mixed effects, multilevel, and hierarchical models
- [ ] Understand use cases of multilevel models
- [ ] Be comfortable with basic MLM math theory
- [ ] Be able to describe error structure of MLMs
- [ ] Understand MLM model assumptions and diagnostics
- [ ] Have created a glossary of key MLM terminology
- [ ] Be familiar with packages for implementating mixed/multilevel models in R
