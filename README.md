## Multilevel Modeling Learning Plan

This plan is a focused and structured approach to learning multilevel models. These are also known as hierarchical linear models (HLMs), linear mixed effects models (LMEs), and linear mixed models (LMMs). Multilevel modeling can be used to model data that has natural groupings within it. 

## Learning Goals

After completing this learning plan, I will

- [ ] know the differences between mixed effects, multilevel, and hierarchical models
- [ ] understand use cases of multilevel models
- [ ] be comfortable with basic MLM math theory
- [ ] be able to describe error structure of MLMs
- [ ] understand MLM model assumptions and diagnostics
- [ ] have created a glossary of key MLM terminology
- [ ] be familiar with packages for implementating mixed/multilevel models in R 

As a result, I should be to apply MLMs rigorously in
marketing mix models, and be able to identify some new use cases for MLMs

I will also create a trail of materials to make it easier for other to learn about MLMs.
