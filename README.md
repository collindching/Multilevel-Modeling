# Multilevel Modeling

Multilevel models, or linear mixed models, are a type of regression that are useful for studying variation between groups. 

In this repo are my notes on the motivations, assumptions, and applications of MLMs. 

## Learning Goals

After completing this learning plan, I will

- [ ] be comfortable with basic MLM math theory
- [ ] be able to describe error structure of MLMs
- [ ] understand MLM model assumptions and diagnostics
- [ ] have a glossary of key MLM terms
- [ ] have analyzed a couple datasets with MLM models
