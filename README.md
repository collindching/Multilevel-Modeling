## Multilevel Modeling Learning Plan

Multilevel models are also known as hierarchical linear models (HLMs), linear mixed effects models (LMEs), and linear mixed models (LMMs). 

In my work at Facebook, I use linear mixed models to quantify marketing impacts on consumer sentiment. This plan is a focused approach to gaining better understanding of multilevel models. 

My core work components for this learning plan are **notes, blog posts, and projects.** 

## Learning Goals

After completing this learning plan, I will

- [ ] know the differences between mixed effects, multilevel, and hierarchical models
- [ ] understand use cases of multilevel models
- [ ] be comfortable with basic MLM math theory
- [ ] be able to describe error structure of MLMs
- [ ] understand MLM model assumptions and diagnostics
- [ ] have created a glossary of key MLM terminology
- [ ] be familiar with packages for implementating mixed/multilevel models in R 

As a result, I should be to apply MLMs rigorously in
marketing mix models, and be able to identify some new use cases for MLMs

I will also create a trail of materials to make it easier for other to learn about MLMs.

## Exercises

Write about 
- [ ] purpose of MLMs
- [ ] assumptions of MLMs
- [ ] difference between fixed and random effect
- [ ] difference between MLE and REML
- [ ] diagnostics of MLMs

Complete project
- [ ] 1 using MLM   
- [ ] 2 using MLM
